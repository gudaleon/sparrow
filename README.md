sparrow
=======

Installation
------------

You can install sparrow from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jsta/sparrow")
```

Data
----

GIS data can be obtained automatically with the `erf_get` function. You need to obtain phosphorus loading data manually before running `p_get` (until the SPARROW decision support system is made available again).
